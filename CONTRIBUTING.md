Hi there!

Thanks for helping out with The Web Toolbox.

If you're making a change to the tool or its data, please check below to see if there's 
anything special you should take in to consideration when making or submitting your changes.

## Adding a new tool
Please make sure your tool checks all of the below criteria:
- Ideally you shouldn't need to sign up to use the tool but, if this is required, it must have a 
free tier available.
- Add a short but useful description and image - help others find out what the tool is at a glance!
- Images must be sized 300x180, and please compress them (I'm sure you can find a tool available :wink:)

Once you're sure your tool passes the above reqiurements please 
[edit the tools file](https://github.com/ToshNeox/webtoolbox/blob/master/app/tools.json), add your image 
and open a pull request.

If you're not comfortable editing the files yourself, just open a pull request with the tool URL 
and name and someone will sort it for you.

## Adding features or fixing typos
Please keep code tidy and commented, so others can understand what you're doing!
